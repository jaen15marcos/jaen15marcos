<h1 align="center">Hi, I’m Marcos, an analyst based in Toronto.</h1>
  
<p>My current role primarily involves in-depth analysis of data from Canadian marketplaces using Kdb+. I mainly work on collaborative research concerning market microstructures and sector trends. With a background in pure mathematics, I am passionate about applying pure maths, statistics, and linear algebra to optimize algorithms in space-time. I also leverage mathematical theories to create trading strategies and to understand the market. I recently came across this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6htbyY3rH1w">video</a> which led me to the paper “Randomized Matrix Decompositions using R” by N. Benjamin Erichson et al., an excellent example of how mathematical theory can enhance software capabilities.</p>
        <p>Born and raised in Panama, my passion for quant finance has brought me to Toronto. I'm always open to chat. My CV can be found <a href="main/about/resume.html">here</a>, and feel free to reach out to me for anything at <a href="mailto:jaenmarcos15@gmail.com">jaenmarcos15@gmail.com</a>.</p>
